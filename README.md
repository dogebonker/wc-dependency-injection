Angular-like dependency injection provider.

## Credits

This code has been taken from the [web components dependency injection](https://www.thinktecture.com/en/web-components/dependency-injection/) article, published by [Manuel Rauber](https://www.thinktecture.com/en/manuel-rauber/) and [Yannick Baron](https://www.thinktecture.com/en/yannick-baron/).

## Notes

> Please, do not use this package if you are not building a whole application with web components.

If your main goal is not the development of a scalable application with web components, do not try to use dependency injection. This approach will make your components not reusable because they are now dependent on project-specific code.

> Keep in mind that you need to control the order of your web components registration.

In order for this package to work correctly, ensure that your DOM tree matches the order of component registration. It is required for the parent component class decorated by `@ContainerProvider` and all of the following component classes in the DOM tree to be registered first. This is because of the web component data flow model - data down, events up. For the possible solutions of this problem, please, refer to [this](https://www.thinktecture.com/en/web-components/dependency-injection/) article.

## Usage

> **_Warning! ‚ö†Ô∏è_**

In order to use this package you will need to declare an `experimentalDecorators` property in either your `jsconfig.json` or `tsconfig.json` and set it's value to `true`.

Considering your web component tree looks like this:

```html
<my-root>
  <my-child></my-child>
</my-root>
```

```js
// my-root.component.js

import { ContainerProvider } from "wc-dependency-injection";
import { Logger } from "@services/logger.service.ts";

@ContainerProvider([{ provide: Logger, useClass: Logger }])
export class MyRoot extends HTMLElement {
  // ...
}

// my-child.component.js

import { Inject } from "wc-dependency-injection";

export class MyChild extends HTMLElement {
  @Inject() logger: Logger;

  connectedCallback() {
    this.logger.log("Hello World!");
  }
}
```

## Installation

```sh
npm install wc-dependency-injection
```
